	  <h1>First Time Hearing Crazy Frog</h1>
	  <p>Bartholomew walked into a bar. He had had a bad day, so he sat at the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. Distasteful music was playing on the speakers, and listening to it made his day gradually worse, though his drink eased it a little. He looked over at the jukebox and saw a man who likely had an ordinary appearance, though over the years Al-Makiya had acquired a high opinion of this man, positively distorting his appearance in Al-Makiya’s perception. He considered this man to be a prophet, or possibly a messenger from a higher, more refined society. Soon after the man left the jukebox, Al-Makiya heard a sound ring out over the speakers. According to his transcriptions of the sound, this is what he heard: “Ding ding pch n daa, bam-ba-ba-re-bam baram bom bom baba-bam-bam-bommm. Wh-Wha-what’s going on-on?”. He later described it as “The kind of sound that others would say emanated from the most annoying thing in the world, or perhaps an insane amphibian, though I would say it came from a higher being, or at the very least a perfectly normal amphibian from my perspective”. After the musical part of this controversial symphony began, Al-Makiya looked around for the man who had queued this song on the jukebox, but he was long gone. He asked the bartender what the name of this song was, and the bartender simply shrugged and told Bartholomew he didn’t know. Bartholomew became very agitated and opened his satchel of Syrian figs. He aimed one directly at the bartender’s head and yelled the question again. The bartender still did not know, but was not as worried as he would’ve been if he knew the risks of high velocity Syrian figs. “I can see you didn’t read my thesis,” Bartholomew said calmly, “Allow me to demonstrate.” Al-Makiya threw the fig to the bartender’s right. It bored a hole into the wall into the neighboring building. He drew another fig and began to aim at the bartender’s head. The bartender was still unable to tell him and began begging for his life. Furious, Bartholomew threw the fig directly between the bartender’s eyes. The large passage it carved through his brain caused him to drop dead on the spot. All other patrons panicked as Bartholomew lost control and began pegging figs at every wall in the bar. He only calmed down after one of the patrons shouted “It’s called Axel F! By Crazy Frog!”. Bartholomew thanked the patron, then ran out of the bar, ran home and spent several hours listening to the music group’s entire discography. He later coined the phrase “To me, crazy frog is just a regular frog”. Crazy frog remains his favourite artist to this day.
