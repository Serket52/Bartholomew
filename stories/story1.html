	  <h1>First Time Playing Blackjack</h1>
	  <p>After completing his doctoral studies, Bartholomew Jun Wei Al-Makiya was quite short on money, spending a large sum and owing a large debt for his education, and being unable to get a job due to the mistreatment of veterans. This desperation led him to take his humble amount of money and visit the casino for the first time. Little did he know, this decision was the turning point in his life. Entering the casino, he was most familiar with the game of blackjack, having played it in the Saudi Arabian military barracks. After he finished placing a bet of half of his chips, the dealer dealt the cards, revealing two sixes. “Hit me”, Bart said. A jack. 
“Bust”, said the dealer.
After finishing, the dealer claimed half of his chips. Bartholomew was dejected. But right at that moment, “Axel F” by the Eurodance music group Crazy Frog started on the casino speakers. “Oh yeah…” he murmured, “This is my jam!”. Reinvigorated, he placed the rest of his chips as his next bet. The dealer dealt. Two four cards slid in his direction. 
“Hit me”.
Another four.
“Hit me”.
Four again.
“Hit me”.
Four once more. He was on a total of 20. The dealer moved to play his own cards, but Bart, once again, said “Hit me!”
The card was a two. “22. Bust” the dealer announced. But Doctor Al-Makiya was not done.
“Hit me.” he said determinedly.
The dealer tentatively gave him another card. It was a card that had not been seen for decades, and would not be seen for decades to come. This card is in all decks, and no decks. It was a phantom ace, the only card to have a negative value. The dealer promptly soiled himself. “21. Just take all the chips in the casino, you deserve them”, he meekly managed to force out around his sobs and tears. A crowd had amassed by now, and every single person in the casino cheered and clapped. Bart collected the phantom ace as a trophy, took every single chip he could find, and cashed them in at the cage.
This money would form a seed fund for his charity work, as well as his future gambling. He never let go of his passion for gambling, and can now be found at his local pub with his phantom ace pinned to his lapel, drinking and playing slots.
